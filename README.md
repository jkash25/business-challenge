# Authentic Hospitality Training Platform

This project is part of the **Marriott HQFI Internship Program Business Challenge**.

## Challenge Overview

Our team's challenge is titled **"Authentic Hospitality"**:  
> To identify and eliminate barriers preventing frontline teams from creating meaningful guest interactions that feel genuine rather than scripted.

## Project Description

This repository contains our solution: a **training platform** inspired by Marriott's Digital Learning Zone (DLZ), enhanced with **LLM-generated content** to help hotel associates improve their guest interaction skills.

The platform includes:
- **Interactive training modules**
- **Instructional videos**
- **Knowledge-check quizzes**

## Key Features

- **Modular Learning**: Structured content that guides employees through progressive learning stages.
- **Performance Tracking**: The system captures detailed metrics for each employee:
  - Time taken to complete modules
  - Number of quiz attempts
  - Date assigned, started, and completed
  - Property location of the hotel
- **Guest Feedback Integration**: Guests will complete a feedback form rating their experience with the employee on a scale of 1â€“10.
- **Data Correlation**: The platform is designed to correlate employee training metrics with guest satisfaction scores to identify patterns and improve training effectiveness.

## Goals

- Empower associates to deliver **genuine, unscripted hospitality**
- Use data-driven insights to **predict and enhance guest satisfaction**
- Provide Marriott with a scalable, intelligent training solution that evolves with frontline needs

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time dashboards for managers
- AI-driven content personalization
- Predictive analytics for guest satisfaction
